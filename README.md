# MongoDB Connection Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when connecting to a MongoDB server using Node.js. The issue involves handling connection errors and providing a robust solution for reconnecting and managing connection pools. 

## Problem Description
The provided JavaScript code attempts to connect to a MongoDB server using the `MongoClient`.  However, it lacks proper error handling, leading to application crashes when connection problems arise.  This could be due to network issues, incorrect connection strings, or server unavailability.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and potentially using connection pooling techniques to ensure a stable and reliable connection to the database.  This includes retries and graceful handling of various connection failures.

## Running the Code
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Install the MongoDB driver: `npm install mongodb`
3. Replace the placeholder connection string in `bug.js` with your actual MongoDB connection URI.
4. Run the script: `node bug.js` (and later `node bugSolution.js`).
